# <u>CSS</u> - Cascadia Style Sheets

***

* CSS is piece of code with gives style to the HTML web page. Meaning of style is anything which makes your web page more good looking is come from CSS.
* e.g. Great Fonts , Shadows , Colors , Spacing etc.
* You can understand CSS with this analogy that HTML is Chassis(Frame of Car without tyres and engine) and CSS is a like accessories of Car , Color and Tyres.


* Basic syntax of CSS is like follows :
  * e.g.


```css

h1{
    color : red;
}
```
In the above syntax , `h1` is HTML tag , `color` is CSS property and `red` is value of the color property. So result of syntax is making `h1` heading in color **red**. So just like syntax we can target any HTML tag and can apply properties.

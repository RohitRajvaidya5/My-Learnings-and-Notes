### Basic HTML programme

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>First HTML Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

```

Above code is basic html **boiler plate** which easily appear if you type `!` in vs code (Visual Studio Code) and press enter.

Some of the concepts regarding above code :

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` &rarr; It defines the document as HTML document (But this is useful in previous times (when netscape navigator exists) but it just syntax part nothing else.)

2. `<html>` &rarr; This is tag which contains all web page contents.

3. `<head>` &rarr; This tag contain mainly meta data which is useful in SEO (Search Engine Optimization), also it contains `<title>` tag which shows the title of website in tab bar.

4. `<body>` &rarr; This tag all the visual content which will show in web page.

There so much to learn about `meta` tags and SEO but for basics and to run html page I think this info is more than enough.
